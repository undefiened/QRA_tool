A json file with blocks (pixels) data is given to be processed, where for each block
the amount of total time spent by all GA there is found, as well as their mean speed
and the collision probability, which is p = p_VC * p_below * Î»_stm. The horizontal
conflict rate p_HC is omitted. These data are stored for each block, and the new blocks
data is saved to disc.
